The YSC program, funded through the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), provides education and employment services to youth, ages 16-24 who are disconnected from education and/or employment.  Partnering with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the program seeks to reconnect youth with education and/or employment.  The YSC program also provides summer youth employment services to Angelenos.  Goals for the YSC program are established by the California Employment Development Department and the US Department of Labor.
