This dataset contains an average snapshot count (over a 1 second interval) of vehicle deployment locations by all Dockless Mobility companies grouped by month and Census Block group within the City of Los Angeles during the Pilot Program only from April 15, 2019 - February 29, 2020. Data is aggregated over a 1 month period, with the exception of April 2019, where data is aggregated from April 15 (deadline for formal compliance) to April 30. Vehicle deployment includes the individual instance a Dockless Mobility company locates a dockless vehicle in the public right of way. Dockless vehicles without a reported status change within 48 hours and vehicles with trips longer than 5 hours were excluded. For more information on vehicle deployment metric and the description of vehicle statuses, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification#mobility-data-specification" target = "_blank"> Mobility Data Specification Github</a> .

This dataset contains micromobility vehicle deployment data reported to the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) as part of the shared Dockless Mobility Pilot Program. This dataset will not be updated on a regular basis. LADOT captures shared dockless mobility vehicle and trip information using the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) API. MDS is an open-source project of the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Open Mobility Foundation (OMF)</a>. 

Geography data (latitude and longitude) is aggregated from all publicly shared Dockless Mobility datasets to protect user privacy.
