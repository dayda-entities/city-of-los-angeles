Los Angeles gets its water from several sources, including local water supplies, recycled water and the Owens Valley. When those sources do not provide enough to meet demand, the DWP must purchase water on the open market from the Metropolitan Water District. Water from the MWD costs more than the other sources, so keeping purchases from MWD low is important to ensuring stable and affordable rates for DWP customers.
