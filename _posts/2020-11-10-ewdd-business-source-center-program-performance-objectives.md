The BSC Program, funded through the CDBG, provides entrepreneurial training, technical assistance and access to capital for micro-enterprise and start-up businesses.  The program promotes job creation for Angelenos by providing entrepreneurs and small businesses the support they need to start and/or expand their businesses.  Goals are established through HUD guidelines and local measures.
