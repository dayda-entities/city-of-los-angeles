The YouthSource System is made up of 13 Youth Centers, with a focus on high school dropout recovery. All centers offer the following services to low-income in-school youth ages 14-21 and out of school youth ages 16-24 with barriers such as basic skills deficiencies or status as a foster youth, youth offender, pregnant/parenting youth, or youth with a disability.
