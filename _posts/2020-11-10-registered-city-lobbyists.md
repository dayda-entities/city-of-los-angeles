An individual who directly communicates with a City official for the purpose of influencing a legislative or administrative matter and is compensated to spend 30 or more hours in any consecutive three-month period engaged in lobbying activities must register with the Ethics Commission as a lobbyist. This also applies to in-house lobbyists (employees who are compensated to lobby only on behalf of their employers).
