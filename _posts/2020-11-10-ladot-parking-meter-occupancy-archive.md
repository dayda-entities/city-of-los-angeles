Monthly archive of all parking meter sensor activity. For current status, see <a href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/LADOT-Parking-Meter-Occupancy/e7h6-4a3e">"LADOT Parking Meter Occupancy"</a>. Updated monthly for data two months prior (eg. January data will be published early March).

This dataset is extremely large. Each CSV file varies in size from 300-600MB. Microsoft Excel will open the file but will truncate all records beyond its capacity. <b>For best results, import into a database or use advanced data access methods appropriate for processing large files.</b>

See <a href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/Parking-Meter-Inventory/s49e-q6j2">"LADOT Metered Parking Inventory & Policies"</a> dataset for location and parking policy details.
