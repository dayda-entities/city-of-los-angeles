The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD)’s Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system is a transactional, event‐driven system that records dates and time stamps based on events triggered by two distinct human interactions: interaction with CAD at the dispatch center via CAD workstation, and interaction with CAD via the Mobile Data Computer (MDC) installed in the responding LAFD unit, communicating with CAD through the LAFD’s Radio Network Controller (RNC).
