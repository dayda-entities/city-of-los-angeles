Monthly and cumulative calendar year to date (CYTD) figures for total TEU counts. TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) is a unit of measure commonly used in the logistics sector to represent shipping containers -- the large boxes used to hold goods during travel by land or sea. This metric reflects the total amount of freight passing through the Port of Los Angeles.
