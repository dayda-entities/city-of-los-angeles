This dataset contains the small cell locations that are attached to streetlight poles citywide.  

A small cell node is a low-powered cellular radio access node that cellular operators use to extend their service coverage and/or increase their network capacity.  

These are smaller and less powerful than traditional macrocell towers or rooftop installations that are served by a high power cell site and utilize a tower, antenna or mast.
