NOTE: Recent Legistration has increased the types of information collected. These changes will be reflected in the data once the state has determined the reporting process.

This dataset reflects incidents of a vehicle or pedestrian being stopped by the Los Angeles Police Department in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2010. This data is transcribed from original stop reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. This data is as accurate as the data in the database. Please note questions or concerns in the comments. 

This dataset is part of the Police Data Initiative (https://www.policedatainitiative.org/). For questions, contact the dataset owner or leave a comment.
