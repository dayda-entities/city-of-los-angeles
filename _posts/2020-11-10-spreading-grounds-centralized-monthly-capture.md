Centralized stormwater capture facilities are engineered features located in specific locations that perform well at capturing large flows when available. In general, these facilities can capture and infiltrate more than 100 acre-feet per year. 

This dataset shows the monthly yield for centralized stormwater capture across LA city for use in the stormwater dashboard and sustainable city pLAn.
