The General Plan is the fundamental land use policy document of the City of Los Angeles. It defines the framework by which the City's physical and economic resources are to be managed and utilized over time. Decisions by the City with regard to the use of land; design and character of buildings and open space, conservation of existing housing and provision for new housing; provisions for the continued updating of the infrastructure; protection of environmental resources; protection of residents from natural and man-made hazards; and allocation of fiscal resources are guided by the Plan.
