Programs are a useful way to break up the budget and understand how the City of LA invests money to make the city safer, more livable and sustainable, better run, and prosperous. Note that departments' use of this field varies, and it is simply for informational purposes. See the Blue Books on http://cao.lacity.org/budget/ for more information.
