The Los Angeles BusinessSource Centers provide startup ventures and current small business owners various cost effective tools to make their business a success. Through these tools, small businesses can grow and remain competitive within the City of Los Angeles.

Startups focuses on owners of businesses with five (5) or fewer employees, one of whom owns the enterprise, and have net operating income of less than Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000).  This focus is particularly important as the majority of the businesses within the City may be categorized as “survivors,” and historically, many such businesses fail in their first two years of operation.  The survival and growth of such businesses is still very important to the ongoing economic vitality of the City.
