The Business Source Center (BSC) Program, funded through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), provides entrepreneurial training, technical assistance and access to capital for micro-enterprise and start-up businesses. The program promotes job creation for Angelenos by providing entrepreneurs and small business the support they need to start and/or expand their business. Goals are established through United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines and local measures.
