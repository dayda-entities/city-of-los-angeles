Subdivisions of parts of the City of Los Angeles for the purpose of promoting sound planning practices and fostering a reasonable mix of land uses. There are 36 Community Planning Areas including the Port of Los Angeles. Thirty-five (35) were defined by City ordinance in the early 1960's. Community Planning Area names are generally designated by hyphenated groupings of neighborhoods and communities.
