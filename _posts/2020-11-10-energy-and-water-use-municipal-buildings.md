In the spirit of leading by example, the City released benchmarking information for municipal buildings. The data includes property name, location, property size (ft²), Energy STAR scores where available, energy intensity (kBTU/ft²), water use (kilo-gallons), total GHG emissions (Metric Tons CO₂e), and several more metrics.
