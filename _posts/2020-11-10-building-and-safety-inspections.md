All permitted construction work are subject to inspection by authorized Building and Safety inspectors. The permit applicant notifies Building and Safety when the work is ready for inspection. Common items inspected include foundation excavations, concrete work, wood framing, ventilation equipment, plumbing, electrical, and so forth. Upon completion, there will be a final inspection and approval of the completed project.
