The Department of Building and Safety is tasked with the enforcement of the City's building, electrical, mechanical and zoning regulations, which are elements of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. A Code Enforcement Case may originate from a customer service request to investigate a possible Code violation, from a planned and authorized inspection of a neighborhood for the purpose of reducing blight, or from a proactive inspection of a site due to an observed hazardous condition.  A case is closed (indicated by a "C" status) when the site satisfies the requirements for Code compliance, or when no Code violation is found.  A case remains open (indicated by an "O" status) until the site satisfies the requirements for Code compliance.
