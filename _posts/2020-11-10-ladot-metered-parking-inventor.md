Inventory of all on-street metered parking spaces in the City of Los Angeles. Includes Space/Meter ID, block-level address, hourly rate, metered time limit, meter operating hours, enforced parking restrictions, and coordinates. Updated as operationally feasible. See <a href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/Parking-Meter-Occupancy/e7h6-4a3e">"Parking Meter Occupancy"</a> dataset for real-time parking availability at over 5,000 spaces.

PLEASE NOTE: Operational changes on the street may create discrepancies between data and posted parking signs. Posted signs determine enforced parking policies.
<b>ALWAYS CHECK AND FOLLOW ALL POSTED SIGNS BEFORE PARKING.</b>
