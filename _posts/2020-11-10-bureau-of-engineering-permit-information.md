The Bureau of Engineering is the City of Los Angeles agency responsible for construction permits within the Cityâ€™s public right-of-way.

The public right-of-way generally consists of street easements that contain City streets, lanes, alleys, parkways, and sidewalks. The public right-of-way also includes public easements and unimproved streets.
