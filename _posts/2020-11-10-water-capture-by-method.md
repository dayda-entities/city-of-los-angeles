Though it doesn't rain often in Los Angeles, the city has various means of capturing rainfall to increase our local water supply. This dataset shows how much water we've capturing cumulatively this season as well as today. 

It is calculated through a script that is available on github here (https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/WaterCapture). When it rains, the dataset will update with new rows every hour.
