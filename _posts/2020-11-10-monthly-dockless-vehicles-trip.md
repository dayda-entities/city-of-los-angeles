This dataset contains an aggregate count of vehicle trip start locations by all Dockless Mobility companies grouped by Census Block Group within the City of Los Angeles during the Pilot Program only from April 15, 2019 - February 29, 2020. Data is aggregated over a 1 month period, with the exception of April 2019, where data is aggregated from April 15 (deadline for formal compliance) to April 30. Vehicle trip starts are where a trip begins in the public right of way. Census block groups where four or less trips occurred within one month were excluded. For more information on vehicle trip start metric, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification#mobility-data-specification" target="_blank">  Mobility Data Specification Github </a>
<p>
This dataset contains micromobility vehicle deployment data reported to the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) as part of the shared Dockless Mobility Pilot Program. This dataset will not be updated on a regular basis. LADOT captures shared dockless mobility vehicle and trip information using the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) API. MDS is an open-source project of the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Open Mobility Foundation (OMF)</a>.

Records with less than 5 trips a month are removed  to protect user privacy.
