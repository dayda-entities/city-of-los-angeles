The Department of Building and Safety is required by the Los Angeles Municipal Code to issue a Certificate of Occupancy for every building or structure in the City of Los Angeles.  A Certificate of Occupancy is a document issued by the Department of Building and Safety certifying a building's compliance with applicable building codes and other laws, and indicating it to be in a condition suitable for occupancy.
