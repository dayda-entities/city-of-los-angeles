The City's Existing Buildings Energy & Water Efficiency (EBEWE) Program was established in 2016 (LA Municipal Code Section 91.9701, Ordinance No. 184674) and is administered by the Department of Building and Safety(LADBS). It requires that owners of buildings subject to the Ordinance, to annually register their building (includes pay fees) and file a benchmark report of energy and water usage for their buildings for the Compliance Year. The EBEWE dataset includes the Compliance Year, Building Address, Compliance Status, various energy and water use benchmark data, and the last 3 digits of the Assessor Identification Number (AIN). For a complete explanation of the Program, including reporting requirements, please visit LADBS' EBEWE site at http://www.ladbs.org/services/green-building-sustainability/existing-buildings-energy-water-efficiency-program.
