The WSC program, funded through the Workforce Investment Act (WIA); National Emergency Grant (NEG) and other competitive grants, provides employment training and placement services for adults and dislocated workers, with a special emphasis on vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, veterans, homeless, English-language learners and older workers.  Annual goals are established by California Employment Development Department and the US Department of Labor.
