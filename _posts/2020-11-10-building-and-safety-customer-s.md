A Customer Service Request is a request received by the Department of Building and Safety from the City's constituents to investigate a site/property for a possible violation of the City's building, electrical, mechanical and zoning regulations, which are elements of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Any investigative action taken by a Building and Safety inspector constitutes the opening of a case. Where no Code violation is found, the case is immediately closed.  If a Code violation is found, the case remains open until the site/property satisfies the requirements for Code compliance.
